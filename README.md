# aws-cloudwatch-agent

An Ansible (works with 1 or 2, for those of us living in the past) role for installing and configuring the AWS CloudWatch Agent to stream local logs. Drop into your roles directory and require in your playbook.

Customize awsconfig.conf with your own preferences as outlined in the [Amazon docs](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/logs/AgentReference.html]).
